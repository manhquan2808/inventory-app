## Project: Production Inventory Management Website

The "Production Inventory Management" website project is designed to manage the production process and control raw materials and products within an inventory system. Below is a detailed description of the process, technologies used, and additional features of the project.

### Process

1. **Product Management Sends Production Request**
   - Product management sends a production request to the raw material manager based on production needs.

2. **Raw Material Management**
   - Receives the production request and checks the quantity of raw materials in stock.
   - If stock is sufficient:
     - Dispatch raw materials to the production workshop.
   - If stock is insufficient:
     - Send a request for raw material replenishment to the supplier.

3. **Supplier**
   - Receives the request and sends raw materials to the raw material warehouse.
   - Raw materials are checked using QR codes:
     - If the materials meet quality standards, they are entered into the raw material inventory.
     - If the materials do not meet quality standards, they are returned to the supplier.

4. **Production Workshop**
   - Receives raw materials from the raw material warehouse and checks the quality and quantity using QR codes:
     - If the materials meet the requirements, production is initiated and the products are entered into the product inventory.
     - If the materials do not meet the requirements, a request is made to return the raw materials to the raw material warehouse.

5. **Product Warehouse**
   - Receives products from the production workshop and checks the quality and quantity using QR codes:
     - If the products meet the requirements, they are entered into the inventory awaiting sale.
     - If the products do not meet the requirements, a destruction report is created.

### QR Code

Each product or raw material through each process is assigned a QR code. This QR code helps to check and track information about the quantity and quality of raw materials and products throughout the management process.

### Additional Features

1. **Chatbox**
   - Integrated chatbox system for seamless communication and coordination between departments. The chatbox supports instant messaging between product management, raw material management, suppliers, production workshops, and product warehouses.

2. **Email Verification**
   - Uses [AbstractAPI](https://www.abstractapi.com/) for email verification. Registration and email changes require verification through email to ensure accurate and secure communication.

3. **User Role Management**
   - The user role management system allows for different access rights based on the userâ€™s role in the system. Roles include:
     - **Product Manager**: Has the authority to send production requests and track request statuses.
     - **Raw Material Manager**: Has the authority to check raw material stock, dispatch materials, and request replenishments.
